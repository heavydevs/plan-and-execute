# Project test resource map

This project-local router maps every automated validation to its toolchain prerequisites, runtime services, and health checks. Keep credentials outside this file. Preflight commands and health probes must be bounded and read-only.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "inventory_reviewed": false,
  "snapshot": {
    "algorithm": "sha256-path-content-v2-streamed",
    "digest": null,
    "source_count": 0
  },
  "toolchains": [],

  "resources": []
}
```
<!-- pae-service-map:end -->

## Maintenance

`service_map.py check` compares this snapshot with a deterministic index of test, build, CI, container, and service configuration inputs. When it reports changes, inspect only those paths, reconcile the validation/resource/check entries, then run `service_map.py stamp --confirm-reconciled`. A fresh digest does not replace the review bit: set `inventory_reviewed` to `true` only after the map is complete.
